# Turing Generative Adversarial Network
I found Turing GAN a way to train GANs quickly! This excited me to write my own versions in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) refering the original Keras [code](https://github.com/bojone/T-GANs).

## Experiments
So, following are my experiments' resulting image data.

### Note
- For all the experiments the images shown below are sampled after 100K iterations of training the Turing GAN on various datasets. 
- All the experiments used spectral normalization for 1-Lipschitz contraint enforcement. 
- I trained all of the Turing GANs with both Jensen-Shannon and Wasserstein divergences.
